Note, the above is guidance only.  Feel free to highlight where you feel you have excelled.  This assignment will be 30% of your final grade.

## Grading

This is worth 60% of your final CA.

# Submission

1. You must use the github classroom repository and commits should be spread over time
2. The grading rubric at the end of this README must be filled in to highlight the areas you believe you deserve marks
3. A video showcasing features and modding must be provided,  Area provided below to provide link.
3. Everything must be contained in this repository
4. A Moodle submission link will be provided to upload a zip of the repository before the deadline
5. Deadline is December the 18th of December 2023, 11am.
6. Non response to issues with submission or non response to questions will result in 10% lost for each incident
7. You may be asked to attend an interview to verify your work, the likelihood of this increases if:
    1. You are not attending lab/lectures
    2. Your labs repository is way behind
    3. You do not commit over time
    4. Suspicion of plagiarism
    5. Particularly weak submission 
8. The use of generative AI is not permitted to generate source code or documentation in this assignment (copilot, chatgpt, or otherwise, locally or hosted)
    1. Generative AI is an excellent tool but you risk not learning fundamental skills by relying on it too soon
9. Usage of any published source should be referenced and documented via comments, you may be asked to explain inner workings of such usages
10. Feel free to have a separate docs directory within the repository e.g. docs/gameplay & docs/modding, docs in markdown only and rendering via github
